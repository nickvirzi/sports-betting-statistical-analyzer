Ideas:

- Need way to validate picks, thinking maybe a yesterday table, run everymorning loads all previous games scores to then be cross referenced to validate previous picks from bet tracker.
- Update DVOA tables will run every tuesday to update the stock DVOA table
- Will make a last 3 dvoa table as well
- live bet tracker, looks for live lines based on start parameters, _ pt fav down _ pts in the _ qtr
- maybe figure out opening line tracker, figure out when dk normally drops opening lines or closest to it
- nba player data integration, compare with player props and check for value based on odds
- nfl handicapper, data in my notebook
